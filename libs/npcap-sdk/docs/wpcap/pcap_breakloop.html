<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
&#35;include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;
void pcap_breakloop(pcap_t *);
</pre>

<p class="level0"><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">pcap_breakloop</span>() sets a flag that will force <span Class="bold">pcap_dispatch</span>(3PCAP) or <a Class="bold" href="./pcap_loop.html">pcap_loop</a>(3PCAP) to return rather than looping; they will return the number of packets that have been processed so far, or <span Class="bold">PCAP_ERROR_BREAK</span> if no packets have been processed so far. 
<p class="level0">This routine is safe to use inside a signal handler on UNIX or a console control handler on Windows, as it merely sets a flag that is checked within the loop. 
<p class="level0">The flag is checked in loops reading packets from the OS - a signal by itself will not necessarily terminate those loops - as well as in loops processing a set of packets returned by the OS. Note that if you are catching signals on UNIX systems that support restarting system calls after a signal, and calling pcap_breakloop() in the signal handler, you must specify, when catching those signals, that system calls should NOT be restarted by that signal.  Otherwise, if the signal interrupted a call reading packets in a live capture, when your signal handler returns after calling pcap_breakloop(), the call will be restarted, and the loop will not terminate until more packets arrive and the call completes. 
<p class="level0">Note also that, in a multi-threaded application, if one thread is blocked in pcap_dispatch(), pcap_loop(), pcap_next(3PCAP), or pcap_next_ex(3PCAP), a call to pcap_breakloop() in a different thread will not unblock that thread. You will need to use whatever mechanism the OS provides for breaking a thread out of blocking calls in order to unblock the thread, such as thread cancellation or thread signalling in systems that support POSIX threads, or <span Class="bold">SetEvent</span>() on the result of <span Class="bold">pcap_getevent</span>() on a <span Class="bold">pcap_t</span> on which the thread is blocked on Windows.  Asynchronous procedure calls will not work on Windows, as a thread blocked on a <span Class="bold">pcap_t</span> will not be in an alertable state. 
<p class="level0">Note that <span Class="bold">pcap_next</span>() and <span Class="bold">pcap_next_ex</span>() will, on some platforms, loop reading packets from the OS; that loop will not necessarily be terminated by a signal, so <span Class="bold">pcap_breakloop</span>() should be used to terminate packet processing even if <span Class="bold">pcap_next</span>() or <span Class="bold">pcap_next_ex</span>() is being used. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">pcap_breakloop</span>() does not guarantee that no further packets will be processed by <span Class="bold">pcap_dispatch</span>() or <span Class="bold">pcap_loop</span>() after it is called; at most one more packet might be processed. 
<p class="level0">If <span Class="bold">PCAP_ERROR_BREAK</span> is returned from <span Class="bold">pcap_dispatch</span>() or <span Class="bold">pcap_loop</span>(), the flag is cleared, so a subsequent call will resume reading packets. If a positive number is returned, the flag is not cleared, so a subsequent call will return <span Class="bold">PCAP_ERROR_BREAK</span> and clear the flag. <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>
